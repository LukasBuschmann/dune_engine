Selective Breeding: no card draw (also cards get drawn before removal) maybe draw works
remove deployable (= 0 )after each agent turn
card draw not working propperly: drawed 4 instead of 5 cards when only 3 cards available in deck after battle
cant change influence, if change would exceed cap (shifting allegiance)
